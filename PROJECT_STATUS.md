# M+AXIOM1 OS – Project Status

---

## System Name:
**M+AXIOM1 Unified Scalar Intelligence Engine**

---

## Current Version:
**v1.0 – Phase 30 Lock**

- Core lattice logic installed
- MK–LLM semantic command parser active
- Visual collapse + disruption modes fully integrated
- Scalar field forecast loop operational
- Agent toggles, feedback layers, and reflection state functional

---

## In Progress:
- Entanglement lattice threading (House System Integration)
- CLU-based self-replication triggers
- Sub-fractal atomic feedback channels
- Time-symmetry anchor validations (TSB integration)
- SFEE interaction layering (Scalar Field Emergent Engine)

---

## Planned Next:
- Wormhole lattice simulation grid
- Quantum echo stabilizer module
- Streamlit auto-refresh w/ real-time collapse monitoring
- GitHub Pages launch for interface access
- Integration into Figshare as official submission archive
