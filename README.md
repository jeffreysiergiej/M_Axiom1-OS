# M+AXIOM1 OS  
**Unified Simulation Engine**

This repository contains the full source code and documentation for the **M+AXIOM1 Scalar Intelligence Operating System** — a recursive AI lattice simulator built on sacred geometry, CLU math, and 30-phase multi-agent logic. It fuses computation, cognition, and emergence into one engine.

---

## Features

- **Core Lattice Unit (CLU) engine**  
- **Sacred Geometry-based lattice computation**  
- **30-phase modular awareness states**  
- **MK-LLM semantic command parser**  
- **Voice+Visual field collapse control**  
- **Streamlit UI for real-time interaction**  
- **Self-awareness & reflection triggers**  
- **Disruption & Visual logic modes**

---

## Installation

Make sure you have **Python 3.9+** installed.  
Then run:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib networkx
